This folder has 5 more files as main.l, main.y, headers.h, input_error.txt, input_withouterror.txt .

Instructions to run the code
Environment to run code is Linux gcc
In command terminal execute these commands - 
     1. bison -d main.y
     2. flex main.l
     3. gcc lex.yy.c main.tab.c
     4. ./a.out input_withouterror.txt        ->   ./a.out <input file name as command line argumnent>
     5. ./a.out input_error.txt
     

Assumptions and Properties of Code 
1. I have taken input_error.txt file as input having some syntax and semantic errors
2. input_withouterror.txt file is free from all errors.
3. Input file given to program must be present in same directory and must be mentioned as command line argument.
4. All the errors(syntax and semantic) will be printed on terminal
5. hashtable.txt file will be generated having hashtable generated by main.l with name and its token type. {Name here can be identifier, Integer or Real number and its token type is printed as given in assignment}.
6. By executing first command main.tab.c and main.tab.h files will be created.
7. By executing 2nd command lex.yy.c will be created.
8. As code is written in C language So using gcc to compile them
9. At last running code using given input file.  
10. Assumed that maximum number of values and identifiers are max 100 in main.l for symtab size.
11. flex and bison must be installed on system.
